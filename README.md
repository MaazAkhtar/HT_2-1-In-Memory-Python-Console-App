Project Details: The Evolution of Todo
Focus and Theme: From CLI to Distributed Cloud-Native AI Systems.

Goal: Students act as Product Architects, using AI to build progressively complex software without writing boilerplate code.


Project Overview
This project simulates the real-world evolution of software. You will start with a simple script and end with a Kubernetes-managed, event-driven, AI-powered distributed system.

Phase Breakdown

Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App
Basic Level Functionality

Objective: Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

💡Development Approach: Use the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.
